# Introduction to If statements

# Create a few variables
my_dogs = 10

# Create an if statement to tell someone if they have too many dogs
if my_dogs > 3:
    print("You have too many dogs")

# Tell someone if they have a lot of dogs
if  my_dogs > 2 and my_dogs < 4:
    print("You have a lot of dogs")

# The perfect amount of dogs
if  my_dogs > 0 and my_dogs < 3:
    print("You have the perfect amount of dogs")

# Too little dogs
if my_dogs == 0:
    print("You dont have enough dogs")
